"""Signed handoffs at accountable-agent boundaries (ADR 0001 S2 criteria 7-9; HAND-01..03).

When work crosses from one accountable agent to another, the runner (A01, scripts/swarm_run.py) writes one
`coord_handoff` packet **as the sender**: through the same `substrate_lease._call` seam the lease bridge uses, with the
sender's own token, so the substrate records and signs the packet as that agent and no agent can sign as another. The
boundaries, all found in code the runner already runs:

  dependency   a task is dispatched and one of its `depends_on` tasks belongs to another agent: that agent → this one
  gate         a gate fails a task (CHANGES_REQUESTED → rework): the gate agent (A08/A09/A10/A12) → the producer
  escalation   the swarm gives up on a task (ESCALATED: rework cap or max_attempts): the producer → A14 when the task
               carries out an A14 work order, else A01; a producer still holding the node hands its lease over

`reconstruct(graph_id, node_id, agent=)` is the receiving side (HAND-02): a task's context rebuilt from
`coord_handoff_list` and `events_query` alone, with no Task Store, run log or bus read.

Fail-open like the rest of the integration: no answer means a `handoff.unsent` warning, a retry on a later round and
a run that carries on; an unsigned packet (no SUBSTRATE_HANDOFF_KEY on the server) is recorded, said to be unsigned
and used. Design notes: docs/substrate-handoffs.md.
