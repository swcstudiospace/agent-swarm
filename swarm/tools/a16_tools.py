"""A16 Cloud-Native Architect tools: pure analyses of where and how a system runs in the cloud.

Tools: cloud_twelve_factor_audit (twelve-factor conformance per factor), cloud_composite_availability (series/parallel
availability math against a target), cloud_dr_feasibility (DR strategy versus RTO/RPO), cloud_data_residency (data class x
region x residency rule), cloud_landing_zone_lint (account/OU hierarchy, guardrails, audit, break-glass),
cloud_wellarch_scorecard (six-pillar weighted scorecard with ranked remediation), cloud_blast_radius (failure-domain
blast radius and single points of failure), cloud_cell_capacity (cell count with N+1 headroom), cloud_cidr_plan (CIDR
overlap and sizing with the stdlib ipaddress module), cloud_managed_vs_self_hosted (weighted decision matrix),
cloud_replica_placement (quorum safety across availability zones), cloud_latency_budget (per-hop latency composition).

Public sources mirrored by the small embedded tables:
* twelve-factor methodology, https://12factor.net (factor names and numbering).
* AWS Well-Architected Framework, six pillars (operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency,
  cost optimization, sustainability) and its disaster-recovery whitepaper strategies (backup and restore, pilot light,
  warm standby, multi-site active/active).
* AWS Organizations: service control policies do not restrict the management account; AWS and Azure reserve 5 addresses
  per subnet; RFC 1918 / RFC 6598 / RFC 4193 private ranges.
Everything else in the findings is this lane's house policy, not a standard, and the tool contracts say so: the twelve-factor
startup (30 s) and deploy-gap (1 day) limits, the break-glass test age (180 days), the landing-zone guardrail vocabulary and the
guardrails each account role needs, the DR timing model (RTO = detect + cutover + validation + the strategy's own step; active/active
skips validation; RPO = backup interval or replication lag) and the readiness order of the strategies, residency severities by
copy kind, the 10% tail-amplification and half-of-target dominant-stage limits, the criticality-8 single-point-of-failure severity,
the 5-point tie margin, and the scorecard weights (none 0, medium 1/2, high 1). They are named constants below.

Identifiers a caller supplies (ids, names, regions, questions) are echoed in findings. A value that looks like a credential, a
64-hex key, a recovery phrase or a PEM block is replaced by a `[redacted:<kind>:<length>:<digest6>]` label before any logic runs, so
it never reaches an id, a summary or an error message; the label is stable, so references between fields still match.
