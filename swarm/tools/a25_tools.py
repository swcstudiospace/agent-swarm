"""A25 Resilience & Chaos Engineer tools: pure analyses over supplied manifests, schedules and measurements.

Boundary: A13 owns SLOs, alerts and incidents; A25 owns resilience evidence and experiments (PDBs, spread, probes,
backups and restore drills, chaos plans, failure modes). Nothing here talks to a cluster: callers pass parsed
manifest fields and measurements, handlers return counts, a ``status`` (pass | warn | fail) and ``findings``
of {id, severity, subject, summary} with severities blocker > major > minor > info (``fail`` on any major or worse).

Tools:
  resil_pdb_check          PodDisruptionBudget versus replicas: blocking, unsatisfiable, missing and permissive budgets.
  resil_spread_check       topology spread and anti-affinity versus zone count: pending pods and zone-loss survivors.
  resil_probe_check        startup, liveness and readiness probe sanity per container.
  resil_backup_coverage    volumes, etcd and databases versus backup schedule, retention, freshness and restore tests.
  resil_restore_rto        restore time estimate from data size and throughput versus the RTO target.
  resil_chaos_spec_check   chaos experiment spec: steady state, blast radius, abort conditions, freeze windows, gates.
  resil_fmea_rpn           FMEA risk priority numbers (severity x occurrence x detection) ranked with a Pareto cut.
  resil_chaos_budget_gate  go / no-go of a chaos experiment against the remaining error budget.
  resil_shutdown_check     terminationGracePeriodSeconds versus preStop and in-flight drain time.
  resil_drill_cadence      DR drill cadence, evidence and measured RTO/RPO versus requirements.
  resil_load_shed_check    load-shedding policy: Little's-law demand, priorities, reservations and queue bounds.
  resil_quorum_safety      StatefulSet quorum safety across zones with its PodDisruptionBudget.

Kubernetes references (public sources):
  * PodDisruptionBudget: policy/v1 (GA 1.21; policy/v1beta1 is no longer served from 1.25, see the Deprecated API
    Migration Guide https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/). minAvailable and
    maxUnavailable are mutually exclusive; percentages are rounded UP for both
    (pkg/controller/disruption, intstr.GetScaledValueFromIntOrPercent with roundUp=true); disruptions allowed =
    currently healthy - desired healthy, never below 0. https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/
  * unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy IfHealthyBudget (default) | AlwaysAllow, stable in 1.31.
  * Pod topology spread constraints: skew = pods in a domain - global minimum; minDomains (stable 1.30) only with
    whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule, and while fewer domains than minDomains exist the global minimum counts as 0.
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/
  * Well-known labels: topology.kubernetes.io/zone; failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone is deprecated.
  * Probes: defaults initialDelaySeconds 0, periodSeconds 10, timeoutSeconds 1, successThreshold 1, failureThreshold 3;
    successThreshold must be 1 for liveness and startup; liveness and readiness start only after the startup probe
    succeeds. https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/
  * Pod termination: terminationGracePeriodSeconds counts down from the deletion and includes the preStop hook;
    0 means kill immediately; a preStop hook that outlives the grace period gets one 2 s extension.
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination
  * Quorum: etcd FAQ, quorum = floor(n/2) + 1, so an even member count adds no fault tolerance.
    https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/faq/
  * Error budget: burn rate 1 spends exactly the whole budget by the end of the SLO window (Google SRE Workbook,
    "Alerting on SLOs"). FMEA: RPN = S x O x D is the classic AIAG ranking; AIAG-VDA 2019 replaced it with Action
    Priority tables.

House policy, NOT Kubernetes, RFC or standards facts (each rule below that applies one says so; callers can read the
numbers in the finding text): liveness failure window under 10 s, startup headroom 1.25x, shutdown margin
max(5 s, 10%), backup staleness at 1x and 2x the RPO and a backup interval equal to the RPO accepted, restore
headroom 10%, a burn rate of 1 or more blocking a production experiment, FMEA severity >= 9 always needing action,
the 80% Pareto cut, "more than half" for a permissive PodDisruptionBudget. Blast radius, duration, reserve and cost
limits, retention and restore-test age are caller inputs, never constants here.

# --- 12. StatefulSet quorum safety -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


def quorum_safety(payload: dict) -> dict:
    """Quorum survival of a replicated StatefulSet (etcd, ZooKeeper, Consul, Raft or Kafka-style) across zones and drains.

    quorum = floor(n / 2) + 1 unless quorum_size overrides it; fault tolerance = n - quorum. A zone may hold at most
    fault-tolerance members to survive its loss, so min_zones_required = ceil(n / tolerance) (-1 when tolerance is 0).
    pdb_disruptions_allowed is the budget with all members ready (-1 without a PodDisruptionBudget).
    Rules: quorum-lost (blocker, unavailable members > tolerance), quorum-below-majority (blocker, a quorum_size under the
    majority when consensus is true, the default: a consensus store can split brain; consensus false is a non-consensus
    replica set such as Kafka min.insync.replicas, where a quorum below majority is allowed and reports no finding),
    no-failure-headroom (major, unavailable == tolerance > 0), no-fault-tolerance (major, tolerance 0),
    even-member-count (minor, default quorum and even n), zone-loss-breaks-quorum (major), pdb-missing (major,
    n >= 2), pdb-unsatisfiable (blocker, desired healthy above n: the rule of resil_pdb_check), pdb-allows-quorum-loss
    (blocker, the budget permits more simultaneous evictions than the tolerance), pdb-blocks-eviction (major, 0 allowed with
    tolerance >= 1: the rule of resil_pdb_check),
    zone-loss-while-degraded (major, some but fewer than tolerance members down, and losing the fullest zone on top
    would drop below quorum; down members assumed outside that zone; at tolerance no-failure-headroom already applies),
    survives_zone_loss describes the healthy cluster. Only majority arithmetic: learners,
    witnesses, rack awareness and leader placement are out of scope.
