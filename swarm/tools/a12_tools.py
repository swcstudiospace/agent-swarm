"""A12 release-manager lane tools: canary decisions, rollback triggers, record checks, delivery metrics.

Mission: decide canary promotion and rollback from supplied telemetry, verify release-record
completeness and promotion-gate order, and compute release-health metrics. Pure logic only;
every input comes from the payload.

Tools:
- rel_canary_verdict: promote, hold, or roll back one canary step.
- rel_rollback_trigger: find the first sustained SLO burn-rate breach.
- rel_release_record_check: list required release-record fields that are missing or empty.
- rel_change_failure_rate: failed-change share of supplied change outcomes.
- rel_deploy_frequency: deployments per week from supplied ISO deploy dates.
- rel_lead_time_p95: median and nearest-rank P95 of commit-to-deploy durations in hours.
- rel_gate_order_check: missing or out-of-order promotion gates.
- rel_gate_freshness: gate verdicts older than their maximum age, or waived without an approval id.
- rel_freeze_decision: deploy freeze from incident alerts, and whether an unfreeze request comes from the authority.
- rel_resume_point: next action after an interrupted canary promotion.
- rel_guardrail_breaches: guardrails one canary sample breaches, and metrics it is missing.
