"""Fail-closed completeness policy for the A16-A30 scanner wrappers.

A scanner that did not analyse every in-scope input must not report ``status: ok``: a CI gate would pass over input
nobody read. A wrapper collects one reason per input it could not analyse (a missing optional tool, an unparsable,
unreadable, binary or oversized file, a file or entry limit, or a file skipped as a symlink), then calls
``incomplete_findings`` before deriving the status with ``scan_status``. Zero analysed inputs is incomplete too.

Reasons carry labels and paths only, never the value that failed to parse: a mistyped field can hold a secret.
