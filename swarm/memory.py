"""Swarm memory is substrate memory (ADR 0001, phase S3).

There is no swarm-side memory store. This module is a thin client over the substrate's one governed door:

* ``memory_write``  -> ``POST {SUBSTRATE_URL}/memory`` (the REST face of the substrate's ``memory_write``). The server decides
  the writer from the bearer token, applies RBAC / quarantine / idempotency / conflict rules and answers with an outcome.
* ``memory_query``  -> the substrate's ``memory_search`` MCP tool.
* ``run_start_context`` -> ``POST /brief`` (the substrate's ``memory_brief``), A01's run-start context.

The read side is fail-open (``[]`` / ``''`` when the substrate is off or down). The write side never pretends: a write is done
only when :attr:`WriteOutcome.ok` is true, i.e. the server said ``accepted`` AND ``verified_persisted``. Everything else is a
named, non-ok status, and a refusal (``denied``) raises ``SwarmError(E-POLICY)``. Storage is reached only through
``swarm.substrate_client``; ``tests/test_swarm_memory.py`` proves that no second memory store exists in this repository.
