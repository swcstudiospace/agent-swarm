"""Tee of the swarm run log to Agent Substrate (ADR 0001, phase S1).

`runlog.emit()` writes the local JSONL record first and then calls `tee()`. The tee turns the record into one
substrate event and POSTs it to /events. It is strictly additive and fail-open: no SUBSTRATE_URL, SUBSTRATE_DISABLED=1,
an unknown Graph ID, an unmapped type, a timeout or any exception means "send nothing" and the caller carries on.
