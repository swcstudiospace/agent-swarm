"""Secret redaction for run-log payloads and telemetry strings (stdlib only).

`redact()` returns a redacted COPY; the caller's object is never mutated. Two independent layers:
  * sensitive keys (see `is_sensitive_key`: a name token that IS or ENDS WITH token, secret, password, credential,
    apikey ... (`PGPASSWORD`, `accesstoken`), a whole-word signing/private/cookie/auth(orization)/bearer, a
    `api|access|secret|private|signing|ssh|encryption|master|auth|session|license|client|ed25519|hmac|jwt|handoff|signer`
    + `key|seed` pair (`SWARM_ED25519_KEY`), or a `<db|mysql|pg|...>_pass|pwd` pair; a name ending in `file`/`path`
    (`SWARM_ED25519_KEY_FILE`) names a location, not a secret): every string beneath such a dict key is replaced.
    Numbers, booleans and None stay, so a counter such as `tokens: 1200` survives. A bare `key`, `seed`, `sort_key`,
    `cache_key`, `author` or `authority` is not a credential.
  * text patterns inside any string: GitHub, `sk-`, AWS, Slack and Bearer tokens, `Authorization: Basic`, JWTs, PEM
    private-key blocks, `NAME=value`, `NAME: value`, `--flag value`, `"NAME": "value"` / `'NAME': 'value'` /
    `\\"NAME\\": \\"value\\"` pairs with a sensitive NAME, and URL userinfo (`scheme://user:pass@host`, the password may
    contain `@`).
A benign name never hides a later assignment (`user=alice,password=x`, `--mode a;--password x`): the scan is one forward pass
that steps past a benign separator, while a sensitive name masks its whole comma-bearing value.
Identifiers (task ids, run ids, correlation ids, `sha256:<64 hex>` digests) and ordinary prose never match.

How a string is redacted (the design that keeps passes from interacting): EVERY detector (names, flags, headers, JSON/YAML pairs, URL
userinfo, PEM, token shapes, command lines) reads the ORIGINAL text and only reports `(start, end)` spans of what must disappear;
`redact_spans` unions overlapping or touching spans and `redact_text` replaces each union by ONE `[REDACTED]`. Nothing is rewritten
while detecting, so no detector ever measures a value another detector already shortened, the order of detectors is irrelevant, and a
secret hidden by any one of them is hidden. A detector that needs a boundary scans linearly to the TRUE end of the value: a value is
never cut by a length cap (a cap would leave a readable tail). Only syntax is bounded (a name <= 127 characters, a gap <= 32 blanks);
command lines are read word by word (see "command-line credentials" below), so no argument is ever skipped by length or count. Every
quantifier that can be re-entered from many start positions is bounded, or its failed scans are remembered, so adversarial input of
megabytes is scanned in time linear in its size.
Masking is idempotent on every shared vector; a mask can newly expose a word boundary (`AKIA...--password x`) and let a second pass hide
more, never less.
Best effort, not a guarantee: it covers the carriers above plus the command-line forms `curl -u user:pass`, `mysql -pSECRET`,
`sshpass -p`, `docker login -p`, `redis-cli -a`, `sqlcmd -P`, `-pass pass:X`; vendor tokens (GitHub, Stripe, Google, SendGrid, Slack, npm,
GitLab, DigitalOcean, AWS key ids, ...); `<vendor>_KEY=<long mixed-case value>`; and YAML `- name: X_PASSWORD` / `value:` pairs and
block scalars (`password: |`). Identifier fields are never free text and are not passed through it (see `swarm.runlog.emit`).
Every option form (`NAME=`, `NAME:`, `--flag value`, `-pVALUE`, `-p VALUE`, `-u user:pass`, `"name": "value"` ...) reads its value through ONE
quote-aware reader (`_Reader`): bare (a backslash keeps a blank), `'..'`, `".."`, ANSI-C `$'..'`, locale `$".."`, the escaped form a double quote
takes inside saved JSON evidence (`\\".."`, and `\\\\\\"..` when it was serialised twice), with blanks, tabs, newlines, `;&|`, unicode and escaped
quotes of its own kind inside. The quote context is computed once per string by ONE left-to-right lexer (`_Lexer`: a stack of open quotes,
backslash escapes, nested quotes of the other kind, prose apostrophes such as `it's` never open a quote; rules in the comment above it) and every
detector queries it; nothing is counted locally and no cache is shared between scans, so a later unmatched quote never changes how an earlier
value is read. A quoted value may span lines; a quote that never closes runs to the end of its line. A quoted value is always a value, even
when it holds only blanks or punctuation. The one quote that is NOT a value is a lone quote that the lexer pairs with an earlier quote of
the same kind on its line (`"mysql -p" ok`: a flag in a sentence).

# ---- the quote lexer ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The quote/escape context of a string is computed ONCE, by ONE left-to-right lexer (`_Lexer`, twin of `Lexer` in omp/src/swarm_bar.ts), and
# every detector QUERIES it: whether a quote OPENS, CLOSES or is plain CONTENT, and where a quoted value ends, is never re-derived locally
# (no counting of same-kind quotes on a line, no cache shared by scans that restart at earlier positions): every answer is a pure function of
# (text, position). Rules, identical in both implementations:
#   * a MARK is a `"` or `'` with the backslashes before it: an odd run of `k` backslashes makes an ESCAPED mark of level `k` (the form a quote
#     takes inside saved JSON: `\"` level 1, `\\\"` level 3), any other run (none, or an even one) a PLAIN mark (level 0).
#   * the lexer keeps a stack of open quotes. A mark of the same kind and level as an open quote CLOSES it (and ends every quote that was opened
#     after it and never closed: a quote nested in a quote ends before the close of the quote that holds it). A PLAIN mark also ends the
#     escaped quotes of its own kind that are open on top of the stack (`\"x"`: the plain quote is the one that closes the JSON string).
#   * any other mark OPENS a quote, nested in the open ones (`"mysql -p'x' db"`, `'a "b c"'`, `"{\"k\": 1}"`), except a PROSE apostrophe or
#     quote: a plain `'` or `"` right after a letter or digit that is not the `-p` of a flag word (`it's`, `don't`, `users'`, `5"`) never
#     opens a quote and is plain content. (`-p'x'`, `-u'a:b'` and `--pass"x"`: the letters belong to a flag word, the quote opens.)
#   * outside quotes, a `#` that STARTS a word (the start of the text, or right after a blank, a newline, `;`, `&`, `|` or `(`, unless that
#     character is backslash-escaped) begins a COMMENT that runs to the end of its line. A comment is text, but the VALUE of a sensitive name is
#     a value wherever it sits. A quote in comment PROSE is a CONTENT mark: it opens and closes nothing, so a stray apostrophe such as `# '` or
#     `# don't` changes no later quote. The VALUE SPAN of a sensitive name in a comment is read as it is outside one: it starts where `NAME=`,
#     `NAME:` (strict names), `"NAME": ` or `--NAME ` (strict) names a sensitive name (the detectors' own test; a `//` after `NAME:` is a URL
#     scheme), and it is a shell WORD: its marks are read by the rules above, so joined segments (`"a"'b'"c"`) and multi-line quotes are one
#     value, until a blank outside quotes ends the word (a blank that a backslash escapes does not), or a `;` or `&` outside quotes when the
#     value is a `NAME=`, `NAME:` or pair value (a flag value reads through them, as `_FLAG_BARE_RE` does), or the line ends. Two readings
#     of one word (`--password :;` is a flag and also `password :`) make one value, the longer. A quote that nothing closes runs to the end
#     of its line. `a#b`, `$#`, `\#` and a `#` inside an open quote are not comments. "Outside quotes" is the lexer's own view: no quote is
#     open on its stack at that point (an unclosed quote still counts as open).
#   * a comment's quote state is bounded by its LINE (shell semantics): at the newline that ends a comment, every quote opened inside it is
#     closed without a closer and runs to that line's end; the lexer never carries an open quote out of a comment, so the next line is read from
#     a clean state (`# PASSWORD="x"'` then `TOKEN='alpha` and `s3cr3t'` read exactly as `TOKEN='alpha` and `s3cr3t'` with no comment above).
#   * quotes of any kind may span lines. A quote that nothing closes runs to the end of its LINE as a value (a truncated log line): the
#     detectors mask from the value start to the end of that line, never a part of it.
#   * a detector that sees a quote where it expects the start of a value asks the lexer: OPEN gives the value's end, a quote the lexer takes
#     for a CLOSE or for prose is read like an opener of its own kind that nothing in the lexer's view contradicts (the next quote of its
#     kind, else the end of the line): over-redacting, never leaving a suffix of the value readable.
