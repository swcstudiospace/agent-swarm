"""Substrate leases for swarm tasks (ADR 0001 S2; LEASE-05..09).

The runner (A01, scripts/swarm_run.py) holds a lease on each task's Graph-of-Thought node on behalf of the agent it
dispatches the task to. It calls as that agent's surface, with session `<AGENT>@<replica>:<graph_id>`, so two replicas of
one agent class are two holders and racing claims grant exactly one. The substrate lease decides who may touch the work;
the Task Store stays A01's record of lifecycle state and keeps only an advisory mirror of the lease in `notes.lease`.

Fail-open like the rest of the integration: off (no SUBSTRATE_URL, --dry-run) means no call and no record; no answer or a
server error means the task runs unleased and says so. A *refusal* is different: the server answered and said no, so the
task is not dispatched. Local request-slot contention also defers dispatch, never masquerading as an outage.
Design notes, the refusal table and the event types: docs/substrate-leases.md.
